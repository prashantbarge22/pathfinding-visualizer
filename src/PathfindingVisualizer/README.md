The accompanying file is the main script of my Pathfinding Visualizer project, a web application that I built recently using React and other front-end web technologies.
Because I wanted a more solid foundation in software engineering and broaden the scope of my skills, I used this personal project as a vehicle to help me learn front-end engineering practices.

For the app itself, users can choose any of the listed pathfinding algorithms, use their mouse to create "walls" on the grid, and watch their chosen algorithm navigate around their walls to find the shortest path from the start node to the end node. Try it out for yourself at https://vincent-ngo31.github.io/pathfinding-visualizer/.
